I am currently a Ph.D student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh. 
I am also a graduate research assistant in the Artificial Intelligence in Products Engineered for X (AiPEX) Lab being directed by Professor Conrad Tucker, who is also my Ph.D advisor. 
My research interests broadly span the areas of model based image processing, machine learning for graphs and network theory.
